PSEUDOCODE ADVENTURE GAME
-------------------------
Name: The Scholar’s Trial
Theme: one room school escape

Story:
=======

"The Final Test"

You wake up in a quiet, sunlit classroom… but something feels off. The door is locked, your phone has no signal, and the ticking of an old clock is the only sound filling the air. A chalk message on the board reads:

“Only those who remember what they’ve learned may leave.”

You're not alone—you're part of a secret educational experiment run by an eccentric former headmaster known only as Professor Quill. According to legend, he believed that true education wasn't about grades—but about using knowledge under pressure. He designed this room decades ago as a challenge… and now it’s your turn to face it.

The Twist:

There are scattered clues that hint this isn’t just an escape room—it’s a test to determine if you're worthy of a mysterious scholar’s society known as The Order of the Chalk. If you escape, you might not just win your freedom… but unlock access to something much greater.
